# Assignment 6 — Safety Rails for Your AI Agent

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will configure safety and control mechanisms for Claude Code using permissions and hooks. You will define team-level command restrictions and implement prompt-level and tool-level hooks to prevent destructive actions before they execute.

# Task 1 — Create Claude Code Configuration Structure

## Goal

Create the `.claude` directory structure required for team-level Claude Code configuration.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — `.claude` folder structure visible in VS Code Explorer

# Task 2 — Create the UserPromptSubmit Hook Script

## Goal

Create a hook that checks user prompts before Claude processes them and blocks requests containing destructive intent.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `user-prompt-guard.sh` open in VS Code showing the hook script

# Task 3 — Create the PreToolUse Hook Script

## Goal

Create a hook that runs before Claude executes Bash commands and blocks dangerous infrastructure commands.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — `pre-tool-guard.sh` open in VS Code showing the hook script

---

# Task 4 — Create the PostToolUse Hook Script

## Goal

Create a hook that runs after Claude executes a Bash command and logs selected Terraform commands.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — `post-tool-logger.sh` open in VS Code showing the hook script

# Task 5 — Configure settings.json to Connect Hook Scripts

## Goal

Configure Claude Code permissions and connect the hook scripts created in the previous tasks.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — `settings.json` open in VS Code showing permissions and hooks configuration
