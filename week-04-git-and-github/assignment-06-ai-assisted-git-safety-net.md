# Assignment 6 — Building an AI-Assisted Git Safety Net (PR Ready Check)

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) Cohort 3 with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In Week 2 you built Claude Code hooks that block a dangerous action *before* it happens (`PreToolUse`), and a restricted skill that could look but not touch (`allowed-tools` without `Write`). In this assignment you will discover that Git has the exact same idea, decades older: a **pre-commit hook** that blocks a commit before it's created.

You will build both halves of a real "PR Ready" workflow:

1. A **Git hook that follows fixed rules** — scans staged changes for hardcoded secrets and oversized files and refuses the commit. No AI involved, no guessing, just a rule that gives the same answer every time.
2. A **restricted Claude Code skill** (`/pr-ready`) that reads your staged diff and drafts a Pull Request title, description, and a short list of things worth a second look — the kind of judgment a fixed rule can't make (mixed changes, missing context, unclear intent). The skill never commits, pushes, or opens the PR. You do that yourself, using its draft as a starting point.

This mirrors the Agentic Loop from Week 3's Linux triage assignment: **Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify**. The hook and the skill both gather and analyze; only you act.

# Task 0 — Confirm Your Fork and Create a Feature Branch

## Goal

Confirm you are working in your own fork, then create a dedicated branch for this assignment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of git remote -v and git branch showing the new branch

---

### Notes

**1. Why create a dedicated branch instead of doing this work on main?**

It makes it easier to review, test, and merge changes safely.

---

# Task 1 — Stage a Change With Realistic Risk

## Goal

On your own fork of this repository (the one you've been submitting your DMI work in since onboarding), create a new branch and stage a change that a real reviewer should catch: a hardcoded-looking secret and a leftover debug statement.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Output of  `git status` showing the staged file on feature/ai-pr-ready

![screenshot](screenshots/ai02.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Why does this assignment use an obviously fake key instead of a real one?**

Because it is not a good practice to push keys or password to github.

---

# Task 2 — Write a Real Git Pre-Commit Hook

## Goal

Create a tracked, shareable pre-commit hook that blocks a commit containing secret-like patterns or files over 1MB.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — `hooks/pre-commit` open in VS Code showing the full script

![screenshot](screenshots/ai03.png)

---

#### Screenshot 3 — Output of `git config core.hooksPath` confirming it points to `hooks`

![screenshot](screenshots/ai04.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Why is `hooks/pre-commit` tracked in the repo instead of living only in `.git/hooks/`?**

hooks/pre-commit is tracked in the repository so the same pre-commit hook can be shared with everyone who clones the project.

---

**2. Compare this to `PreToolUse` from Week 2 Assignment 6. What does each one intercept, and what do they have in common?**

They are both bash script and they both enforce safety rules.

---

# Task 3 — Prove the Hook Blocks the Risky Commit

## Goal

Attempt to commit the staged file from Task 1 and show the hook rejecting it.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 4 — Terminal showing `git commit` rejected with the hook's "BLOCKED" message naming the exact file

![screenshot](screenshots/ai05.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Which line in `hooks/pre-commit` matched your fake key, and why did it match?**

Line 7, using grep to call the fake key

---

**2. Could this hook have caught a poorly-named variable that stores a secret without the `AKIA` prefix? What does that tell you about the limits of a fixed rule like this?**

No. The hook only looks for specific patterns like the AKIA prefix or private key headers, so it could miss a secret stored in a poorly named variable without those patterns. 
This shows that fixed rules are useful but have limitations

---

# Task 4 — Build the `/pr-ready` Skill

## Goal

Create a manually invoked Claude Code skill that reads your staged changes and produces a PR-readiness report and a draft PR description — without writing, committing, or pushing anything itself.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — `SKILL.md` frontmatter showing `allowed-tools: Bash, Read, Grep` (no `Write`) and `disable-model-invocation: true`

![screenshot](screenshots/ai06.png)

---

#### Screenshot 6 — `/pr-ready` output while the risky file is still staged, showing it flagged the secret and/or debug statement

![screenshot](screenshots/ai07.png)

---

### Notes

**1. Why does `/pr-ready` have `Bash` and `Read` but not `Write`?**

Because it not alowed to edit or create files

---

**2. The pre-commit hook and `/pr-ready` both looked at the same staged diff. Did they flag the same things? What did one catch that the other didn't?**

/pr-ready provides a broader code review, while the pre-commit hook enforces only specific security and file-size rules

---

# Task 5 — Fix the Issues and Re-Verify

## Goal

Remove the secret and debug statement, then prove both gates now pass clean.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — `git commit` succeeding after the fix (no BLOCKED message)

![screenshot](screenshots/ai08.png)

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Second `/pr-ready` run showing a clean risk report and a drafted PR title + description

![screenshot](screenshots/ai09.png)

---

### Notes

**1. What exactly did you change to satisfy the pre-commit hook?**

I changed the access key to variables 

---

# Task 6 — Push and Open a Pull Request Using the AI Draft

## Goal

Push your branch and open a real Pull Request, using `/pr-ready`'s drafted title and description as your starting point — read it critically and edit before you use it.

**Important:** Open this Pull Request with base repository set to **your own fork** — not the shared upstream `pravinmishraaws/devops-micro-internship-pravinmishra` repository. This assignment's hook and skill files are your own practice work, not a change meant for the shared class repo.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Your Pull Request showing the base repository is your own fork, plus the title and description, with the `/pr-ready` draft visible for comparison (paste it in the PR conversation or your notes below)

#### PR Link

(https://github.com/walefolarin0-glitch/devops-micro-internship-pravinmishra/pull/1)

---

### Notes

**1. What, if anything, did you edit in the AI's drafted PR description before using it? Why?**

I did not edit anything

---

**2. If you had blindly copy-pasted the AI's draft without reading it, what could go wrong?**

The AI could make mistake, Its imoprtant to always review.

---

**3. Why does this PR need to target your own fork instead of the shared upstream repository?**

The PR targets my own fork because I have permission to push branches and create pull requests there

---

# Task 7 — Map the Workflow to the Agentic Loop

## Goal

Explain this assignment's workflow using the same Gather → Analyze → Human Act → Verify structure from Week 3.

### Notes

**1. Which step(s) represent Gather?**

The Gather step is when the pre-commit hook checks the staged files and when /pr-ready runs git status and git diff --cached to inspect the staged changes. These steps collect information before any action is taken.

---

**2. Which step(s) represent Analyze?**

The Analyze step is when the pre-commit hook checks for secrets and oversized files, and /pr-ready reviews the staged changes for issues, then drafts a PR title and description. These steps evaluate the gathered information and identify potential problems.

---

**3. Which step is Human Act, and why must a human — not Claude — run `git commit`, `git push`, and open the PR?**

The Human Act step is running git commit, git push, and opening the Pull Request. A human must perform these actions because they permanently change the repository and require human approval before code is shared or merged.

---

**4. Which step is Verify?**

The Verify step is checking that the pre-commit hook passes, reviewing the /pr-ready results, and confirming the commit succeeds without errors. This verifies that the code meets the required checks before creating the PR.

---

**5. In one or two sentences: why do you need *both* the fixed-rule pre-commit hook and the AI skill? Isn't one enough?**

The pre-commit hook enforces fixed security rules, such as blocking secrets and oversized files, while the AI skill reviews broader code quality issues like debug statements, untracked files, and PR documentation. Using both provides stronger protection because each catches issues the other may miss.

---

# Task 8 — LinkedIn Post

## Goal

Publish a LinkedIn post summarizing what you built and what you learned about combining fixed-rule safety checks with AI-assisted review.

### Evidence

#### LinkedIn Post URL

(https://www.linkedin.com/posts/wale-folarin-956b6022a_dmibypravinmishra-git-github-ugcPost-7485765800935538688-TKyj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADl6z1IBZjWVdPX--51VXY7TxU7dXOVzE3c)
